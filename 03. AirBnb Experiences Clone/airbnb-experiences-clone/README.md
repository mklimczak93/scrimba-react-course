### 03. Airbnb Experiences Clone
Third project of the course was done as a work-along and the premise of this exercise was introduction of a concept of props. 
A simplified version of thr main page of Airbnb Experiences Clone was built, with each 'Card' of an experience created as a component getting data from an external data.js file imported and mapped in the ListOfCards file.
