            Originally, I have education and experience in architecture and in this field I have worked for 5 year
            both in Poland and abroad. After that time I have decided to move back to Poland and into web development.
            I now interlace my experience of design thinking, technical aptitude and finding symbiotic solutions for 
            complex problems in the newly chosen field.
