### 0.4 Travel Journal
Fourth project of the course - done on my own - a travel journal with entries about various travel destinations. It was designed based on provided Figma file, however the code was written independently.
Again, this project focused on the idea of inroducing simple "data-base" - a .js file with a simple travel info objects array. In the ListOfEntries file I mapped a previously written Entry component to each list object using Array.map().
