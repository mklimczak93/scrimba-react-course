First project of the course, done as a work-along. A static website with basic facts about React, done in order to practice the newly learnt library from the design offered by the course.

### 02. Digital business card
Second project of the course, done on my own - a digital business card. The design heavily relies on propsed Figma file, but the whole code was written independently. Added some responsiveness to the design.

### 03. Airbnb Experiences Clone
Third project of the course was done as a work-along and the premise of this exercise was introduction of a concept of props. 
A simplified version of thr main page of Airbnb Experiences Clone was built, with each 'Card' of an experience created as a component getting data from an external data.js file imported and mapped in the ListOfCards file.
