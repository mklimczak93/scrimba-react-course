### 02. Digital business card
Second project of the course, done on my own - a digital business card. The design heavily relies on propsed Figma file, but the whole code was written independently. Added some responsiveness to the design.

### 03. Airbnb Experiences Clone
Third project of the course was done as a work-along and the premise of this exercise was introduction of a concept of props. 
A simplified version of thr main page of Airbnb Experiences Clone was built, with each 'Card' of an experience created as a component getting data from an external data.js file imported and mapped in the ListOfCards file.

### 04. Travel Journal
Fourth project of the course - done on my own - a travel journal with entries about various travel destinations. It was designed based on provided Figma file, however the code was written independently.
Again, this project focused on the idea of inroducing simple "data-base" - a .js file with a simple travel info objects array. In the ListOfEntries file I mapped a previously written Entry component to each list object using Array.map().
