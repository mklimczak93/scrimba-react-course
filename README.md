## "Learn React" course projects

This is a repo for projects done for the Scrimba "Learn React" course. 

### 0.1 Fun facts about React
First project of the course, done as a work-along. A static website with basic facts about React, done in order to practice the newly learnt library from the design offered by the course.

### 02. Digital business card
Second project of the course, done on my own - a digital business card. The design heavily relies on propsed Figma file, but the whole code was written independently. Added some responsiveness to the design.
